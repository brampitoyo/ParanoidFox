# ParanoidFox
A Firefox add-on designed for maximum privacy and security

Made with Mike Kaply’s [CCK2](https://mike.kaply.com/cck2/).

# Installation
Drag the `.xpi` file to your Firefox icon. Click “Install”, then “Restart”.

## Caveats

* Always install on a new profile
* Removing the add-on via `about:addons` doesn’t undo the changes it has made. To do this, go to `about:config` and Refresh Firefox.

# Editing
You can either:

1. Go to `/xpi/cck2.config.json` and add/remove things as necessary
2. Or [download CCK2](https://mike.kaply.com/updates/cck2wizard/cck2wizard-latest.xpi), click the CCK2 icon on your toolbar, click “Import”, then select the `cck2.config.json` file
