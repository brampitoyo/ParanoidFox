# SecureFox
A Firefox add-on designed for maximum privacy and security

Made with Mike Kaply’s [CCK2](https://mike.kaply.com/cck2/).

# Installation
Drag the `.xpi` file to your Firefox icon. Click “Install”, then “Restart”.

## Caveats

* Always install on a new profile
* Removing the add-on via `about:addons` doesn’t undo the changes it has made. To do this, go to `about:config` and Refresh Firefox.
